Factors such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to grow supply and demand on the platform, competition from other companies, and local regulations will all play a role in determining Uber's revenue growth. Additionally, the success of initiatives such as Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass, as well as the ability to penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on the platform outside metropolitan areas, will also influence Uber's revenue growth.\n"
